# TrafficLightDetection
### Abstract
The code in this repository evaluates the adaption of tensorflow models to traffic light detection, as part of [ a self-driving-car project](https://github.com/bdschrisk/CarND-Capstone-Project). The models were downloaded from the [tensorflow model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md), the test images are from the popular [COCO dataset ](http://cocodataset.org/#home).
